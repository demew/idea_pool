The project ideas I get most excited about are the sort that have absolutely no
utility beyond my own personal whimsy (or very limited utility outside of this
whimsy).

Creating this repository to store those ideas as they come to me, so I have a
reminder of things I've wanted to work on when I want to learn a new tech (or
to get better at a particular tech, or to solve a not-particularly-pressing
problem).

The plan here is one file in the format idea.txt to store the idea.

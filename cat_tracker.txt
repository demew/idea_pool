1. Attach gps device to collar on all four cats

2. Map out a graphical representation of house

3. Map graphical representation to real-world location coordinates

4. Create webapp that uses gps devices to locate cats and then puts a
    coordinating image representing each cat showing their location
    in the house

5. Webapp has user / authentication established so only people I feel
    safe sharing this information with can view the house / cat locs

6. Now when one of the cats has mysteriously vanished we can identify
    whether or not they have escaped the house or are just passed out
    hardcore in some special hiding spot

7. Abstract the code enough so the code is public but the personal details
    are not.  PERHAPS EVEN other people can attach gps devices to their
    animals and have equal entertainment
